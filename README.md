# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
 #### The dataset named "Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset" comes from a study conducted in 1988 and originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
 ##### Features
 * age. The age of the patient.
 * sex. The gender of the patient. (1 = male, 0 = female).
 * cp. Type of chest pain. (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non — anginal pain, 4 = asymptotic).
 * trestbps. Resting blood pressure in mmHg.
 * chol. Serum Cholestero in mg/dl.
 * fbs. Fasting Blood Sugar. (1 = fasting blood sugar is more than 120mg/dl, 0 = otherwise).
 * restecg. Resting ElectroCardioGraphic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy).
 * thalach. Max heart rate achieved.
 * exang. Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
 * oldpeak. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
 * slope. Peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping).
 * ca. Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by flourosopy.
 * thal. Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect).
 * num. Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = absence, 1, 2, 3, 4 = present).
